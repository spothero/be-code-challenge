# **Sample Problem**

------------
## The Application
Build an API that allows a user to enter a date time range and get back the price at which they would be charged to park for that time span

### API Endpoints
- The application publishes an API with two endpoints that computes a price for an input datetime range.
- The API must respond to requests on port `5000`
- The API must respond using JSON

#### Rates
The first endpoint is `rates`.

This path takes a `PUT` where rate information can be updated by submitting a modified rates JSON. This submitted JSON overwrites the stored rates.

- A rate is comprised of a price, time range the rate is valid, and days of the week the rate applies to
- See the section `Sample JSON for testing` for the initial set of rates.

This path when requested with a `GET` returns the rates stored.

#### Price
The second endpoint is `price`. It allows the user to request the price for a requested time.

- It uses query parameters for requesting the price
- The user specifies input date/times as ISO-8601 with timezones
- The paramters are `start` and `end`. 
- An example query is `?start=2015-07-01T07:00:00-05:00&end=2015-07-01T12:00:00-05:00`
- Response contains `price`
  - ```
    {
       "price": 5000
    }
    ```

##### Response Requirements
- User input can span more than one day, but the API mustn't return a valid price  - it must return `unavailable`
- User input can span multiple rates, but the API mustn't return a valid price - it must return `unavailable`
- Rates will not span multiple days

### Application startup
Rates are specified by a JSON file to be automatically loaded on start of the application. The format of this file is the same JSON structure that can be submitted to the `rates` endpoint.

## Other Requirements

- Preferred languages are Python, Kotlin, Java, or Go to complete this
  * If you are planning on using a different language, please let the recruiting team know your language of choice
- API endpoints must be documented
- Tests need to be in place
- There must be documentation that one can follow to run the application
- We will be running automated requests against your submission. Please take care to follow the requirements laid out.

## Extra Credit

- Include a Swagger Spec
- Include a Dockerfile
- Metrics for endpoint(s) captured and available to be queried via an endpoint (e.g. average response time). Add the metrics you feel would be appropriate to identify the health and performance of your application

## Submitting

* Zip up your submission and submit it via GreenHouse
  * You can achieve this with `git archive --format zip --output /full/path/to/zipfile.zip master` if using git
* Include any instructions on how to build, run, and test your application

## Sample JSON for testing
```json
{
    "rates": [
        {
            "days": "mon,tues,thurs",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "tz": "America/Chicago",
            "price": 1500
        },
        {
            "days": "fri,sat,sun",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "tz": "America/Chicago",
            "price": 2000
        },
        {
            "days": "wed",
            "times": "0600-1800",
            "tz": "America/Chicago",
            "price": 1750
        },
        {
            "days": "mon,wed,sat",
            "times": "0100-0500",
            "tz": "America/Chicago",
            "price": 1000
        },
        {
            "days": "sun,tues",
            "times": "0100-0700",
            "tz": "America/Chicago",
            "price": 925
        }
    ]
}

```
The timezones specified in the JSON file adhere to the 2017c version of the tz database. Assume that there could be other (non America/Chicago) timezones specified. For more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

Assume that rates in this file will never overlap

## Sample result
Datetime ranges must be specified in ISO-8601 format.  A rate must completely encapsulate a datetime range for it to be available.


* `2015-07-01T07:00:00-05:00` to `2015-07-01T12:00:00-05:00` must yield `{'price': 1750}`
* `2015-07-04T15:00:00+00:00` to `2015-07-04T20:00:00+00:00` must yield `{'price': 2000}`
* `2015-07-04T07:00:00+05:00` to `2015-07-04T20:00:00+05:00` must yield `"unavailable"`
